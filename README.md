# Real-time-Chat-App

This is a simple, real-time, group chat based application which makes use of web sockets for its functioning. Web sockets provide a full duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, that stays open all the time reducing latency. Spark framework has been used for providing the web sockets. Java HTML Builder (j2html) and CSS have been used for building the user interface and Javascript has been used on the client side.

## Tools Used

Spark framework, j2html, CSS, Javascript, Java 
IDE used: Eclipse 

## Getting Started

Download Eclipse from the [official page](https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/), and ensure that the Eclipse version you downloaded supports Maven.
